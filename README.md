# JNeuroHashMap
A HashMap implementation using Neural Networks for indexing.

Inspired by this article (https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1712.01208v1/ Chapter 4 - Point Index) I decided to create a Neural Network backed Java HashMap since it offers a lot of performance gaining in accessing the map. This is useful if you're working with big in-memory datasets and for small tables, this would be a huge overhead.
